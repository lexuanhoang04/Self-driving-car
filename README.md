# Self-driving-car
In this project, I improved the lane-detecting algorithm of an existing self-driving car project: https://github.com/lgthevinh/VIA-mini-instructions?zarsrc=1303
Initially, the algorithm only work occasionally on straight lanes and can not work at corners.
After improvements, the car can travel stablly on straight lanes and corners
